# Cooling and Heating Loads
- **Room Loads** (space cooling load, Space heat extraction rate) - the rate at which thermal energy is removed from a space by terminal heat transfer devices. For radiant systems the sum of the convective and radiant heat transfer rates at the chilled surface. For all-air system, the sensible enthalpy difference between supply and return air flow.
- **Hydronic heat extraction rate** (system loads) - the rate at which thermal energy is removed by the hyrdronic system. The enthalpy difference between supply and return chilled water flow. For radiant ceiling panels the hydronic extract rate will be similar to the space heat extraction rate. It will be different for high thermal mass radiant system like embedded surface and thermally activated building surface systems.
- **Internal heat gain rate** - the sum of convective and radiant heat gain from internal sources (lighting, people and equipments).
- **Solar heat gain rate** - the rate at which solar energy is transmitted through glazing into the interior space.
- **Envelope heat transfer rate** - the net sum of convective and radiant heat transfer rates at the interior surface of the envelope.

## Notes on Radiant Systems
- **For All-Air Cooling**: most interior surfaces possess higher temperature than room air.
    - directly removes convective load, radiative load acummulates and removed later with a time delay.
    - results in higher operative temperature, due to higher surface temperatures.
- **For Radiant Cooling**: interior surfaces are cooled to reduce heat transfer from surface to air. If the surface temperature goes below air temperature. They will cool the air.
    - cooling load is increase due to faster heat extraction from the surfaces, espeically for room dominated with radiative heat gains. Heat extraction is almost instantaneous. Thus resulting in higher design load.
- **Different cooling load scenarios**
    - primarily radiative heat source: people, lightings
    - primarily convective heat source: computers, refrigerators

- sizing of radiant panels depends on 1) the type of dominant heat source radiative or convective and 2) control setpoint temperatures, air temperature vs operative temperature

- separation of MRT and air temperature only happens when 1) primary heat gain is convective and 2) operative temperature is used for controls
