# Motivation - Designing for Climate Change
## Climate Change
This is a summary of my understanding of climate change. I have summarize concepts from these two books {cite}`goldstein-rose_100_2020,doerr_speed_2021` and heavily copied text from the IPCC AR6 Mitigation Report. I am attempting to highlight the key points relevant to designers of the built environment from my reading. This entry serves as a note for myself.

Climate change is the biggest crisis of our time. In 2019, 59+-6.6 GtCO2-eq is emitted into the atmosphere. Green House Gases (GHGs) traps radiation and heats up the surface temperature of earth. The main classes of GHGs are listed below:
  - Carbon Dioxide (CO2) - The primary GHG. It comes from fossil fuels combustion and industrial processes & landuse changes and forestry
  - Methane (CH4) - From livestock and agriculture
  - Nitrous Oxide (N2O) - fertilizers
  - Fluorinated Gas (F-Gas) - hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) as well as nitrogen trifluoride (NF3).
- Aerosols provide cooling by reflecting radiation back to space. However, it is bad for human health.

Our world is warming up due to the increase of GHGs in our atmosphere (<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/kristen_bell_giant_ant_why_is_the_world_warming_up?referrer=playlist-5_questions_about_climate_change&autoplay=false" target="_blank">why our world is warming up?</a>). We are releasing too much GHGs into the atmosphere (<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/kristen_bell_giant_ant_where_does_all_the_carbon_we_release_go?referrer=playlist-5_questions_about_climate_change&autoplay=false" target="_blank">where does all the carbon goes when we release them?</a>). CO2 is the primary GHG in our atmosphere, as a result we often use GHG emission and carbon emission synonymously in our daily conversation. For easier accounting a metric called Giga Tonnes Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (GtCO2-eq) is invented to measure the amount of GHGs released into the atmosphere. In order to reduce the increase of avearge surface temperature of the earth to below 1.5degC (<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/kristen_bell_giant_ant_why_is_1_5_degrees_such_a_big_deal?referrer=playlist-5_questions_about_climate_change&autoplay=false" target="_blank">why 1.5degC?</a>), we need to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 (<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/kristen_bell_giant_ant_what_is_net_zero?referrer=playlist-5_questions_about_climate_change&autoplay=false" target="_blank">what is net zero emissions?</a>).
### Overall Solution
Overall solution to mitigate climate change are {cite}`goldstein-rose_100_2020,doerr_speed_2021`:
1. Decarbonize the grid and use renewable energy sources
2. Electrification
3. Synthetic fuel
4. Decarbonizing industry and agriculture
5. Carbon removal technologies
6. Protect nature

### Urban Systems
Urban areas generated ~28 GtCO2-eq of combined global CO2 and CH4 emissions in 2020 through the production and consumption of goods and services.

**Mitigation**

1. Reducing urban energy consumption across all sectors, including through spatial planning and infrastructure;
2. Electrification and switching to net zero emissions resources
3. Enhancing carbon stocks and uptake through urban green and blue infrastructure, which can also offer multiple co-benefits.
4. Socio behavioural aspects, can shift energy demand and emerge as the result of implementing the strategies.

Designers of our built environment can facilitate zero emissions through well-designed urban form. Urban form is the resultant pattern and spatial layout of land use, transportation networks, and urban design elements, including the physical urban extent, configuration of streets and building orientation, and the spatial configuration within and throughout cities and towns {cite}`lynch_theory_1981,handy_methodologies_1996`.

Low carbon cities have the following characteristics (referred to as compact walkable urban form):
1. Co-located medium to high densities of housing, jobs, and commerce;
2. High mix of land uses;
3. High connectivity of streets; and
4. High levels of accessibility, distinguished by relatively low travel distances and travel times that are enabled by multiple modes of transportation.

5Ds of Transport Oriented Development (TOD) based on:
1. density,
2. diversity (mixed land uses),
3. design (street connectivity),
4. destination accessibility, and
5. distance to transit.

A good urban form, compact, walkable and transport oriented, enables the implementation of other mitigations strategies in the city, such as effective public transport to reduce vechicle miles travelled (VMT)/vechicle kilometer travelled (VKT).

**Adaptation**

Even at the most optimistic scenario of limiting the warming to below 1.5degC, adaptations of our urban systems will be required to deal with a certain level of sea-level rise and increase occurance of extreme weather events.

### Buildings
Global GHG emissions from buildings were 12 GtCO2-eq in 2019, equivalent to 21% of global GHG emissions. Of this, 57% (6.8 GtCO2-eq) were indirect emissions from offsite generation of electricity and heat, 24% (2.9 GtCO2-eq) direct emissions produced onsite and 18% (2.2 GtCO24 eq) were embodied emissions from the production of cement and steel used in buildings. The construction of high-performance buildings will become by 2050 a business-as-usual technology with costs below USD20 tCO2-1 in developed countries and below USD100 tCO2-1 in developing countries.

Main drivers of emissions:
1. Population growth, especially in developing countries,
2. Increase in floor area per capita, driven by the increase of the size of dwellings while the size of households kept decreasing, especially in developed countries,
3. The inefficiency of the newly constructed buildings, especially in developing countries, and the low renovation rates and ambition level in developed countries when existing buildings are renovated,
4. The increase in use, number and size of appliances and equipment, especially ICT and cooling, driven by the growing welfare (income), and
5. The continued reliance on fossil fuel based electricity and heat slow decarbonisation of energy supply.

**Mitigation**

The aggregation of results from all these bottom-up studies translates into a global mitigation potential by 2050 of at least 8.2 GtCO2. The largest mitigation potential (5.4 GtCO2) is available in developing countries while developed countries will be able to mitigate 2.7 GtCO2.

The SER framework introduces a hierarchical layering, sufficiency first followed by efficiency and renewable, which reduces the cost of constructing and using buildings without reducing the level of comfort of the occupant. The three pillars of the SER framework tackles the causes of the environmental impacts of human activities:
1. Sufficiency - avoiding the demand for materials, energy, land, water and other natural resources while delivering a decent living standard for all within the planetary boundaries {cite}`saheb_cop26_2021,princen_principles_2003`.
2. Efficiency - improving energy and material intensities
3. Renewables - reducing the carbon intensity of energy supply

In most regions, historical improvements in efficiency have been approximately matched by growth in floor area per capita. Implementing sufficiency measures that limit growth in floor area per capita, particularly in developed regions, reduces the dependence of climate mitigation on technological solutions (medium evidence, medium agreement). Sufficiency interventions in buildings include the optimisation of the use of building, repurposing unused existing buildings, prioritising multi-family homes over single-family buildings, and adjusting the size of buildings to the evolving needs of households by downsizing dwellings. Sufficiency measures do not consume energy during the use phase of buildings.

The critical role of the decade between in 2020 and 2030 in accelerating the learning of know-how and skills to reduce the costs and remove feasibility constrains for achieving high efficiency buildings at scale and set the sector at the pathway to realize its full potential. Its segment representing rented property faces principal/agent problems where the tenant benefits from the decarbonisation investment made by the landlord.

**Adaptation**

Actions are needed to adapt buildings to future climate while ensuring wellbeing for all. The expected heatwaves will inevitably increase cooling needs to limit the health impacts of climate change.
