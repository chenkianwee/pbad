# Design Processes
Introduction to design processes that can support mitigation and adaptation of our built environment for climate change.

## A Framework for Understanding Built Environment Design Process
A built environment design project can be generally broken down into 7 main categories based on the scale of the design project {cite}`mcclure_built_2007`. The seven categories are:

- Products - products such as graphic design, furniture, laptops.
- Interiors - space within a structure.
- Structures - external form constructed from products that contained interior spaces.
- Landscapes/Urban Designs - planned outdoor spaces.
- Cities - structures and urban areas clustered together defining a community.
- Regions - cities and landscapes group together due to common social, political and economical characteristics.
- Earth - all of the above.

The categorization provides a guide for design practices to have a holistic view of their project by situating it within the broader context of the built environment. There is a content <-> component <-> context relationship between the categories. For example if you are designing a building (structure), you will need to be aware of the content in the building (interior) and where the building is situated (context). It provides a framework for the things to consider when approaching a design project.

Generally, a design project can be separated into 4 main work stages, **Pre-design, Design, Construction, Operation** {cite}`chen_framework_2022`. A fifth stage **Demolition** could be added to it, however it is not common practice yet for designers to consider demolition during design.

- Pre-design - conceptualize the design brief e.g. site selection, specifications etc.
- Design - propose design solutions.
- Construction - design and build the chosen solution.
- Operation - operate and maintain the built artefact.

Within each stage, there will be a set of deliverables. The deliverables can be drawings, 3D models, mock-ups or the actual built artefacts. Within each stage, design tasks are performed to deliver the deliverables. Design tasks can be sorted into 5 main types, **Formulating, Moving, Representing, Evaluating and Managing** {cite}`lawson_design_2009`.

- Formulating - identify and frame the design problem. Refer to {doc}`02_1_formulate` for further discussion.
- Moving - propose/modify solutions to the design problem.
- Representing - communicate solutions through drawings, models and mock-ups.
- Evaluating - assess the solution based on certain criteria.
- Managing - reflects on the design process and decide the next step.

This framework can be used to describe various design processes listed below:
