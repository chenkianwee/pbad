# Formulating a Design Problem
The act of design can be described with the following logic {cite}`dorst_core_2011`.

```
What (the thing) + How (Working Principle) = Outcome (Desired Value)
```

In a conventional problem, designers are designing a thing that operates within certain scenarios (a pattern of relationships in a context) to achieve the desired value. Both the How and Outcome are known.

```
? + How = Outcome
```

In an open complex problem both the What and How are unknown. The only known is the Outcome, what the design is supposed to achieve.

```
? + ? = Outcome
```

To resolve such an open and complex problem. Designers can work backwards from the only known aspect. By proposing a different working principle that can facilitate the achievement of the Outcome. A designer is framing the design problem.

```
? + How? = Outcome
    <----------->
        Frame
```  

With the framing, designer can then approach the problem conventionally. As a designer proposes new What solutions, each solution can be tested by observing the Outcome generated when the What + How is put together. If the Outcome observed is desired, we can say the proposed solution is a successful solution.

```
What + How = ?
```
