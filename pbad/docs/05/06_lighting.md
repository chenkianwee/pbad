- **Illuminance (Lux)**: the total amount of light that falls on a surface
    - measured with handheld light meter or spectrometer.

- **Luminous flux/luminous power (Lumens)**: the total amount of light emitted in all directions by a light source. Often used in light bulbs specifications.
    - measured with goniosphere or integrating sphere.

- **Luminance (cd/m2)**: Luminance is often used to characterize emission or reflection from flat, diffuse surfaces. Brightness is the term for the subjective impression of the objective luminance measurement standard.
    - A typical computer display emits between 50 and 300 cd/m2. The sun has a luminance of about 1.6Ã—109 cd/m2 at noon
    - measured with luminance meter.
